Surface-guided GANs is an automatic full-body anonymization technique based on Generative Adversarial Networks.

The key idea of surface-guided GANs is to guide the generative model with dense pixel-to-surface information (based on [continuous surface embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12438)). This yields highly realistic anonymization result and allows for diverse anonymization.
